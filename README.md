## Python solutions and solution checkers to Leetcode problems which will actually run in Python3

Many leetcode problems won't actually run with the example code they give if you try to directly transpose them to run in your own python environment. The tests for solutions only work when pressing check solution in leetcode's propriatary online environment. 

These solutions run the online examples in straight python3 on your local machine (or wherever you run your python scripts) so you can see what's going on a little easier.
